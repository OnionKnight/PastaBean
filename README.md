# PastaBean
Python Script to Scrape Pastebin with Regex. This is by far a 'finished project' and plan to improve this over time.
My goal is to make PastaBean as flexible as I can and simple to run with minimal requirements to capture data.

## Background
Created script to learn Python and capture data on the popular site https://Pastebin.com.

## Features
- Scrape Pastebin, 100 queries per 60 seconds.
- Write matches to text file in same directory.
- E-mail alert. Have to manually add credentials for sender and receiver  into script(Gmail Only).

## Requirements
- Pastebin PRO account to use the API to scrape. Need to Whitelist IP.

## Future Improvements (In no order)
- Improve current RegeX
- Add more Regex Matches!!!
- Create base64 exe decoder
- Enable to allow script to write to custom file path
- Reduce duplication in e-mail alerts.
- Decreased status output to one line.
- Generate log file for each alarm to replace e-mail alerts (Maybe JSON).
- Expand to other similar sites like pastebin.
